# EVM-Reserch

The analysis is a comparison of activity on EVM blockchains, including metrics such as daily transactions, active addresses, as well as average block creation time and daily block count.

There are 3 sectors, namely:

- Main On-chain metrics
- Stablecoins on EVM chains
- Price of native tokens

And in the "Main On-chain metrics", you can select 3 different category: Transactions, Active Addresses and Blocks. Each of those 3 category will show you some interesting data.
